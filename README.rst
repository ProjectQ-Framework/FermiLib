FermiLib is an open source effort for analyzing quantum simulation algorithms.

The first version (v0.1a0) is an alpha release which features data structures and tools for obtaining and manipulating representations of fermionic Hamiltonians. FermiLib is designed as a library on top of ProjectQ and leverages ProjectQ to compile, emulate and simulate quantum circuits.

Getting started
---------------

To start using FermiLib, simply follow the installation instructions in the `intro <https://github.com/ProjectQ-Framework/FermiLib/tree/master/docs/intro.html>`__. There, you will also find `code examples <https://github.com/ProjectQ-Framework/FermiLib/tree/master/examples.html>`__. Also, make sure to check out the `ProjectQ
website <http://www.projectq.ch>`__ and the detailed `code documentation <https://github.com/ProjectQ-Framework/FermiLib/tree/master/docs/>`__.

How to contribute
-----------------

To contribute code please adhere to the following very simple rules:

1. Make sure your new code comes with extensive tests!
2. Make sure you adhere to our style guide. Until we release a code style 
   guide, just have a look at our code for clues. We mostly follow pep8 and use the pep8 linter to check for it.
3. Put global constants and configuration parameters into src/config.py, and
   add 'from config import *' in the file that uses the constants/parameters.

Documentation can be found `here <https://github.com/ProjectQ-Framework/FermiLib/tree/master/docs/>`_.
